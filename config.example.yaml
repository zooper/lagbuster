# Lagbuster Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize for your environment

# Edge router peers to monitor
peers:
  - name: edge01
    hostname: edge01.example.com
    expected_baseline: 45.0  # milliseconds - your expected "good" latency
    bird_variable: core01_edge01_lagbuster_priority

  - name: edge02
    hostname: edge02.example.com
    expected_baseline: 55.0  # milliseconds
    bird_variable: core01_edge02_lagbuster_priority

  - name: edge03
    hostname: edge03.example.com
    expected_baseline: 52.0  # milliseconds
    bird_variable: core01_edge03_lagbuster_priority

# Health check thresholds
thresholds:
  # Switch away from current primary if it degrades by this much from its baseline
  degradation_threshold: 20.0  # milliseconds

  # Stay on current primary if within this comfort zone above baseline
  comfort_threshold: 10.0  # milliseconds

  # Hard limit - any peer exceeding this is considered unhealthy regardless of baseline
  absolute_max_latency: 150.0  # milliseconds

  # Treat ping timeout as this value for comparison
  timeout_latency: 3000.0  # milliseconds

# Damping settings to prevent route flapping
damping:
  # Require this many consecutive unhealthy measurements before switching away from current primary
  consecutive_unhealthy_count: 3

  # How often to measure latency
  measurement_interval: 10  # seconds

  # Minimum time between switches (cooldown period)
  cooldown_period: 180  # seconds (3 minutes)

  # Size of rolling window for tracking measurements per peer
  measurement_window: 20  # number of measurements to keep

# Startup behavior
startup:
  # Wait this long before making first priority change (allows baselines to stabilize)
  grace_period: 60  # seconds

  # Initial primary peer (by name) - will be used until grace period expires
  initial_primary: edge01

  # Preferred primary for automatic failback (optional)
  # If set and failback is enabled, lagbuster will automatically switch back to this peer
  # after it has been healthy for the configured duration
  preferred_primary: edge01  # must match a peer name above

# Automatic failback to preferred primary
failback:
  # Enable automatic failback to preferred primary when it recovers
  enabled: true

  # Number of consecutive healthy measurements required before failing back
  # With measurement_interval=10s, 180 measurements = 30 minutes of sustained health
  consecutive_healthy_count: 180  # measurements (e.g., 180 Ã— 10s = 30 minutes)

  # Wait for cooldown period to complete before allowing failback
  # If false, failback can happen immediately after consecutive_healthy_count is reached
  # If true, must also wait cooldown_period seconds since last switch
  require_cooldown_before_failback: true
